<h2>Privacy Matters</h2>
<p>This is a public website available to every creep, crook, spook, and despot
in the entire world. The web crawling spiders of every search engine will have
already indexed and cached all the personal identity information here.
The info-sec industry calls this a "data breach".
There is no way to reverse this damage. It's too late now.</p>

<p>We should not be putting anyone's personal details here, <i>especially</i>
vulnerable young students who do not yet know enough about the world to realise
why they should protect their own personal data. We have a duty of care.</p>
